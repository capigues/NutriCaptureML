# NutriCapture Machine Learning Model
## Setup Instructions
To set your device up to edit and run the ML model:
1. First install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com) 
2. After anaconda is installed, open Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda Navigator (it should be automatically installed with anaconda)
3. Download this repository from github
4. Open NutriCapture.ipynb in Jupyter notebook

## Commiting to this repository
To make sure we are keeping the model organized follow these conventions when uploading edits
1. Create a branch `git branch <branch-name>`
2. Switch to branch `git switch <branch-name>`
3. Save edits `git add .`
4. Commit edits `git commit -m '<quickly explain changes>'`
5. When ready to add changes to final model push these changes to GitHub. Follow the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
